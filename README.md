# Mage Flame

Mage Flame is a small mod that adds the ability to create dynamic light sources that follow you wherever you go. This is executed by using scrolls crafted from vanilla ingredients. No mana, no spell points, no mage classes, no level. Just craft and use.

The ability of a spellcaster to create or summon a light source great or small has become synonymous with the most common and easily attainable spell - Mage Flame.
